goals:
      The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize
      the workshop participants with best practices and tools in modern research
      software development. The main focus is on professional tools
      for efficiently developing and maintaining research software.
      Since most research code is developed in a collaborative
      setting, we will discuss tools and workflows which facilitate
      this process. Most of the content is also relevant to
      a single developer.
      <p>
      Note that a workshop covering HPC topics will be held on June 13-15, see
      <a href="https://cs.hi.is/HPC/hpcworkshop2018.html"> Nordic High Performance Computing & Applications Workshop</a>.
      While both are funded by NeIC, the topics and trainers are different.
