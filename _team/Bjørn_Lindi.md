Bj√∏rn Lindi | NTNU |  assets/img/team/bjoern_lindi.jpg

I used to be a HPC-manager, but I am transforming into a sustainble Research Software Engineer. My background is in electrical engineering and I have experience from different software companies. Do also enjoy baking, and make Ruislimmppu regularly.
