## Get involved

Welcome! :wave: :thumbsup: :clap: :ok_hand:

### Workshop helpers

Have you already participated in a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop, but would like to attend another one 
to refresh your memory and share your own knowledge? Or do you already have a solid background 
in research software engineering and would like to meet like-minded people in a friendly 
environment? Join a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop as a helper! [Get in touch](../contact) and let 
us know which workshop you would like to join.
