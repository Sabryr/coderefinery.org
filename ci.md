## Your code has tests? We have the hardware!

Please get [in touch](/contact) if you would like to run your automated tests
on our hardware. See below for some interesting use cases of this service.


## Team behind the CI service

This service is operated with support from The Danish National Life Science Supercomputing Center.
Computerome is a HPC Facility specialized for Life Science. Users include
Research groups from all Danish Universities and large international research
consortiums as well as users from industry and the Health Care.


## Use cases

### [Nordugrid ARC](http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/)

The Nordugrid ARC software package recently migrated from the Apache Subversion
version control system to [GitLab hosted by Coderefinery](/repository). Nordugrid ARC is a
software product which enables computing clusters around the world to connect
to the World Wide Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid (WLCG).

> "With GitLab we now not only have a version control system (git), but also a
> very good platform for discussing changes to the source-code, performing
> automatic build upon commits, and setting up a testing infrastructure. We are
> using GitLab extensively now, and plan to expand the automatic deploy and
> testing that GitLab offers in the near future." [Maiken Pedersen]


### [Dalton and LSDalton](http://daltonprogram.org)

> "The Dalton project consists of several feature-rich programs. This is
> reflected in the test set which is thus very demanding. Using the CodeRefinery
> CI service, we are able to run the test set in a reasonable time, thus
> accelerating the development workflow, and additionally it allows us to run the
> individual tests in both serial and parallel mode."
