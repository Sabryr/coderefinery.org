## How to inform us about issues

Please contact `radovan.bast@uit.no`. We will soon set up a proper email support line.


## Known issues

Currently none.


## Why not using the issue tracker on the GitLab service for submitting issues?

We are considering it but we are also worried that people will post and expose
user account information.
