The Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) is a national research
infrastructure that provides a balanced and cost-efficient set of resources and
user support for large scale computation and data storage to meet the needs of
researchers from all scientific disciplines and from all over Sweden
(universities, university colleges, research institutes, etc). The resources
are made available through open application procedures such that the best
Swedish research is supported.
