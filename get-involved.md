## Workshop helpers

Have you already participated in a CodeRefinery workshop, but would like to attend another one 
to refresh your memory and share your own knowledge? Or do you already have a solid background 
in research software engineering and would like to meet like-minded people in a friendly 
environment? Join a CodeRefinery workshop as a helper! [Get in touch](../contact) and let 
us know which workshop you would like to join.

## Contribute to teaching material

All our lessons are [on GitHub](https://github.com/coderefinery). Contributions to the 
lesson material are highly welcome! The best way to contribute is via the forking-pull request 
workflow. See our lesson on [collaborative version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/02-distributed/) for an overview of how this works. You can also [contact us](../contact) 
via other channels.
