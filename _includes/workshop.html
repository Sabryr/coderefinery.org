            <h3>Course goals</h3>
            <p>
                The aim of this course is to demonstrate and familiarize the
                students with best practices and tools in modern research software development.
                The main focus is on professional tools for developing and maintaining research
                software efficiently. Since most research codes are developed in a
                collaborative setting, we will discuss tools and workflows which facilitate
                this process. But also for a single-person development the demonstrated tools
                will prove invaluable.

            <h3>Who the course is for</h3>
            <p>
                If you are writing code that is used in research, then this course is for you.
                If you develop research code and you know all the tools already, become a helper! It's fun!
