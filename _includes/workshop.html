            <h3>Course goals</h3>
            <p>
                The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize
                the workshop participants with best practices and tools in modern research
                software development. The main focus is on professional tools
                for efficiently developing and maintaining research software.
                Since most research code is developed in a collaborative
                setting, we will discuss tools and workflows which facilitate
                this process. Most of the content is also relevant to
                a single developer.
            </p>

            <h3>Format</h3>
            <p>
                Hands-on informal and interactive three-day event with type-along type of
                presentations, live coding and demos. Short tutorials alternate with practical
                exercises.
            </p>
