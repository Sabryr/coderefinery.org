  <p>
  Are you interested in becoming an instructor in CodeRefinery workshops?
  Are you teaching a university course and would like to include 
  aspects of best practices in software engineering in the course?
  Or would you simply like to educate your friends and colleagues in 
  how to write more reusable, reproducible and better documented code?
  </p>
  <p>
  If you answered yes to any of the above questions, we welcome you to 
  join the first CodeRefinery instructor training workshop! This workshop
  will focus on how to teach technical topics (e.g. version control with 
  Git, automated testing or programming languages) in general, and 
  CodeRefinery lessons in particular. We will cover key pedagogical ideas
  and teaching methods, and what you need to know in order to teach the 
  CodeRefinery lessons. All the material will be firmly grounded in the 
  experience that CodeRefinery staff has acquired after teaching over 25
  workshops to over 600 participants.
  </p>
  <p>
  This instructor training workshop will immediate precede a hackathon 
  event at KTH where researchers are invited to bring their code and data
  and work on it collaboratively with other participants. 
  We would like to bring over ideas from the instructor workshop to the 
  hackathon, so participants of this workshop are especially encouraged
  to attend also the hackathon to work on lesson improvement and development 
  of new CodeRefinery lessons!
