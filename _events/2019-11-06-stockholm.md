### Welcome to the first CodeRefinery hackathon!

The idea behind this event is to bring together people who are working with
code and/or data in research, in an informal environment where ideas can be
exchanged, expertise shared and real work done!

What you can do at the hackathon:
- Bring your own code or data and get suggestions/help on how to better organize, test,
  document, and share your code.
- Participate at a ReproHack where we try to reproduce a nominated paper and learn how to make
  software papers better reproducible. You can nominate your own paper and then you get feedback
  about how to improve your own work.
- Work on new or existing CodeRefinery lessons.
- Share your expertise with others and learn many new tricks and tools from others.

What we will ask you to provide when registering:
- Nominate two papers for the ReproHack (can be your papers or somebody else's).
- Suggest at least one project that you would like to work on with others.
- If you bring your own code or data where you would like to get expert suggestions, please give
  us some background information.
