### Welcome to the first CodeRefinery hackathon!

The idea behind this event
is to bring together people who are working with code and/or data in
research, in an informal environment where ideas can be exchanged, expertise
shared and real work done! Participants are invited to bring their code,
datasets or other projects to work on, and discuss and solve any challenges
together with other experts. Some possible topics that you can bring up
in the context of your specific project are:
- How can I organize my project better?
- How can I improve my usage of version control and automated
  testing frameworks?
- What license should I use for my project?
- What are some interesting ways I could analyze this new dataset that
  I have?
- Should I have a data management plan? How should it be?
- I want to teach other members in my research group better software/data
  management practices. How can most efficiently bring them up to speed?

This hackathon will immediately follow after an instructor training workshop
at KTH focusing on how to teach CodeRefinery workshops. Many participants
from that workshop will also attend the hackathon, so we welcome
topics related to teaching, such as:
- Developing a new CodeRefinery (or other) lesson.
- Improving existing CodeRefinery lessons.
- How to set up and teach a CodeRefinery workshop.

Most importantly, you are invited to bring any topic or problem from
your own work. If there is a particular problem you would like to
discuss and work on during the hackathon, please provide some background
information on the problem when you register!
