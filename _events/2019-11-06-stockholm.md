description:
  Welcome to the first CodeRefinery hackathon! The idea behind this event 
  is to bring together people who are working with code and/or data in 
  research, in an informal environment where ideas can be exchanged, expertise 
  shared and real work done! Participants are invited to bring their code,
  datasets or other projects to work on, and discuss and solve any challenges 
  together with other experts. Some possible topics that you can bring up 
  in the context of your specific project are&#58;
  <ul>
  <li> How can I organize my project better? </li>
  <li> How can I improve my usage of version control and automated 
  testing frameworks? </li>
  <li> What license should I use for my project? </li>
  <li> What are some interesting ways I could analyze this new dataset that 
  I have? </li>
  <li> Should I have a data management plan? How should it be? </li>
  <li> I want to teach other members in my research group better software/data 
  management practices. How can most efficiently bring them up to speed? </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  This hackathon will immediately follow after an instructor training workshop
  at KTH focusing on how to teach CodeRefinery workshops. Many participants 
  from that workshop will also attend the hackathon, so we welcome 
  topics related to teaching, such as&#58;
  <ul>
  <li> Developing a new CodeRefinery (or other) lesson. </li>
  <li> Improving existing CodeRefinery lessons. </li>
  <li> How to set up and teach a CodeRefinery workshop. </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  Most importantly, you are invited to bring any topic or problem from 
  your own work. If there is a particular problem you would like to 
  discuss and work on during the hackathon, please provide some background 
  information on the problem when you register!
