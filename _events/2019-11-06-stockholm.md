### Welcome to the first CodeRefinery hackathon!

The idea behind this event is to bring together people who are working with
code and/or data in research, in an informal environment where ideas can be
exchanged, expertise shared and real work done!


#### What you can do at the hackathon

- Participate in a **2-day project**
- **Bring your own code or data** and get suggestions/help on how to better organize, test,
  document, and share your code.
- Participate at a **ReproHack** where we try to reproduce a nominated paper (can be your own paper!) and learn how to make
  software papers better reproducible.
- Develop a **new CodeRefinery lesson**.
- **Share your expertise** with others and learn many new tricks and tools from others.


#### 2-day project

- To participate in this session, please propose a project. For this please
  email us a project title and an abstract.
- We will also soon list here already proposed projects.


#### Bring your own code or data

- To participate in this session, please provide us with some background information about your code/data.


#### ReproHack

- To participate in the ReproHack, please nominate one paper which we will try
  to reproduce as a group. You can nominate your own paper and then you get
  feedback about how to improve your own work.


#### Develop a new CodeRefinery lesson

- Ideas: web scraping, regular expressions.


#### Share your expertise

- We will schedule short informal presentations where you can show something
  cool you have built or learned.
